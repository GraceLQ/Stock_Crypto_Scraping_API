# Realtime Bitcoin Price API Scraping and Visualization

## Overview
This project demonstrates how I scraped, processed, and visualized Bitcoin price data using the CoinGecko API via the Python wrapper PyCoinGecko. It retrieves Bitcoin price data for the previous 30 days, processes it into a structured DataFrame, and visualizes the results with an interactive HTML-based candlestick chart generated using Plotly.

## Technical Skills Highlighted
- Worked with **RESTful APIs** for retrieving real-time and historical data.
- Used **Pandas** for data manipulation, such as aggregating daily price metrics, and converting time-series data.
- Created interactive candlestick charts using **Plotly**.

**This is a screenshot of the interactive candlestick chart.**
